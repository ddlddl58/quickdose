# QuickLook (beta)#

QuickDose is a set of tools for producing radiological outputs with Langrangian particle dispersion model [FLEXPART](http://flexpart.eu). QuickDose was inspired by [flexRISK](http://flexrisk.boku.ac.at/) project.

The project is under development. Currently it has following features:

* Prepares a set of FLEXPART runs corresponding with a given source term needed for dose calculation
* Calculates radioactive decay (including parent-daughter decay chains) and actual releases of all nuclides form the source term
* 

## How does it work? ##
